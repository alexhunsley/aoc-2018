# Part 2:
#
# More efficient square summing:
# (yeah, we knew this was coming!)
#
# For square size S, maintain a horiz sum of S starting at some X.
# To move right, subtract leftmost item, add rightmost. 
# Likewise, for moving down, we have a list of these horizontal sums.
# We chop off start of list and add to end to move downwards.
#
# Before doing a right move, copy the horiz sum list so we can restore later.
